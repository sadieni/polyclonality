# polyclonality_2024
This repository contains data and code to reproduce the analysis and results from *Sadien et al (2024)*.

## Purpose
The files contained in this repository accompany the manuscript **_Polyclonality overcomes fitness barriers in Apc-driven tumorigenesis_**. The following analyses have been included here:
1. Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment based on bulk RNA sequencing from major and minor clones (_Figure 2_)
2. Pipeline for pseudo-bulk RNA sequencing (Figure xx)
3. Mutational probability analysis in _Apc_ for major, minor and monoclonal samples (_Figure 2j_)
4. Confetti crypt labelling simulation (_Extended Data Figure 1f_)
5. Random collision modelling (_Extended Data Figure 1n-p_)
6. _Apc_ allele phasing (long read sequencing data) (Figure xx)

## Downloading data
Raw sequencing files have been deposited to:
1. [NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for bulk RNA sequencing data. Accession number: *GSE272850*.
2. [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) for amplicon-sequencing and long-read sequencing data. BioProject ID: *PRJNA1141743*.
