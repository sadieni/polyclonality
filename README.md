# polyclonality_2024
This repository contains raw data and custom code from *Sadien et al (2024)*.

## Purpose
The files contained in this repository accompany the manuscript **_Polyclonality overcomes fitness barriers in Apc-driven tumorigenesis_**. The following analyses have been included here:
1. Confetti crypt labelling simulation (_Extended Data Figure 1f_)
2. Random collision modelling (_Extended Data Figure 1n-p_)
3. _Apc_ mutation bootstrap analysis (_Figure 2j_)

## Downloading accompanying raw data
Raw sequencing files have been deposited to:
1. [NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for bulk RNA sequencing data. Accession number: *GSE272850*.
2. [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) for amplicon-sequencing and long-read sequencing data. BioProject ID: *PRJNA1141743*.
