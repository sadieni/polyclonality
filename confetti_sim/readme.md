# Confetti labelling simulation
This PERL script produces data shown in **Extended Data Figure 1f**.

The observed frequency of _RFP_, _YFP_ and _CFP_ crypts is input in the script in turn. The output is a table of patch sizes and their frequency for the colour in question. The uploaded version of the script is for CFP-labelled crypts at an observed frequency of 2.8%. These parameters need to be changed depending on the use case.
